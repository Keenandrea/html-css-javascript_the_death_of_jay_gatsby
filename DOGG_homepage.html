          <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
          <p>The Death of Jay Gatsby took place on a Wednesday morning in September 1922. Invitations were mailed well in advance. Gatsby himself had written them; on his MacBook Pro.</p><p>Here is what Gatsby had written:</p><p>Mr. Jay Gatsby, The Great</p><p>Affluential Host and Undisclosed Bootlegger</p><p>Requests the Honor of Your Presence</p><p>On the Occasion of his Demise</p><p>West Egg 3:20 p.m.</p><p>Snacks will be Provided</p><p>By 5th of September, Please RSVP</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
          <p>One can imagine the feelings of the invitees: Our Gatsby! preparing to quit his 180-some-odd paged world! and so-such. Great Gatsby! who has given us so much shindiggery! and so-such. A shimmering example of human achievement, that Gatsby. But also a muppet. That rare breed of muppet whose tragedy is brought on by its own blinkered arrangement to unsee that what matters most is mostly killing it. Like a whale, sort of, kind of, beached, dehydrating, collapsing under its own weight, or drowning when high tide covers the blowhole.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
          <p>People prepared to attend the death of Jay Gatsby as they might have for a mandatory staff meeting. There were debates as to whether the object of their being there ought to matter. Did any among them establish a kinship with Mr. Gatsby? was a the lacktherof enough? By September 5th, a mountain of invitations, down to the last, explicitly containing names, were returned, each including its own lengthy justification for unattendance.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
          <p>Nick Carraway, by a very long chalk, demonstrated the most furor. Enough furor to blow a house down. Jackals! he continued to shriek aloud while pasing the sumptuous chamber, flipping antique furniture, leaving in his wake a path of upside-down antique furniture. Leeches! A cuss on their mouldy hearts! (yanking an antique Edwardian endtable out from under itself [floral arrangement set atop endtable spilling fantastically everywhere.]). A coterie of stewards, having nothing better to do, trailed closely behind Mr. Carraway, reinstituting Carraway's displacement of furniture. Whether this was for the benefit of the chamber and its altogether altogetherness, or for the longevity of Mr. Carroway's furor within the chamber, remains untold.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
          <p>Jay Gatsby himself waited, in a leather smoking chair, which, contrary to the popular naming convention, was neither on fire, nor smoking. He looked extremely tired, yet calm, assuming a very blue look. Almost indigo, was his look. And it never changed color. Not once throughout his death. Not even when Nick Carraway suspended his furor to perform impressions for Gatsby, impressions of famous contemporary film stars: Rudolph Valentino, Harold Lloyd, Harry Houdini, and Gatsby's favorite, Charlie Chaplin. Not even then. Gatsby remained posed, silent before the shut window, ruefully gazing eatward.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
          <p>And there, east, across the dark body of water, several electricians deployed by Ameren UE, stood in joint scrutiny round the foot of a mighty metal pole, where, on the tippy-top, a single green bulb, in a state of disrepair, signaled nothing for nobody.</p>
