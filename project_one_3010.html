				<p>The Death of Jay Gatsby took place on a Wednesday morning in
				September 1922. Invitations were sent out well in advance. 
				The invitations read:</p>
				<h3>Mr. Jay Gatsby, The Great</h3>
				<h3>Affluential Host and Undisclosed Bootlegger</h3>
				<h4>Requests the Honor of Your Presence</h4>
				<h4>On the Occasion of his Demise</h4>
				<h4>West Egg 3:20 p.m.</h4>
				<h4>Snacks will be Provided</h4>
				<h4>RSVP by 5th of September</h4>

				<div class="accordion-content" id="second">
				<p>
				One can imagine the feelings of the recipients. Our great 
				Gatsby! Preparing to quit the world! and so on. Mr. Great 
				Gatsby! Who has given us so much shindiggery! and so and 
				so. Verily, a fine example of human achievement. But on 
				the whole, it has to be said, a tragic mishap arranging 
				to come about, like a whale, beached, dehydrating, 
				collapsing under its own weight, or drowning when
				high tide covers the blowhole.

				<p>
				People prepared to attend the death of Jay Gatsby as they
				might have for a mandatory staff meeting. There were debates
				as to whether the object of their being there ought to matter.
				Did any among them establish a kinship with Mr. Gatsby? was a 
				the lacktherof enough? By September 5th, a mountain of
				invitations, down to the last, explicitly containing names, 
				were returned, each including its own lengthy justification 
				for unattendance.

				<a href="#fourth" class="accordion-header">Nick's Furor</a>
				<div class="accordion-content" id="fourth">
				<p>
				Nick Carraway, by a very long chalk, demonstrated the most 
				furor. Enough furor to blow a house down. Jackals! he 
				continued to shriek aloud while pasing the sumptuous 
				chamber, flipping antique furniture, leaving in his wake a 
				path of upside-down antique furniture. Leeches! A cuss on
				their mouldy hearts! (yanking an antique Edwardian endtable 
				out from under itself [floral arrangement set atop endtable 
				spilling fantastically everywhere.]). A coterie of stewards, 
				having nothing better to do, trailed closely behind Mr. 
				Carraway, reinstituting Carraway's displacement of furniture.
				Whether this was for the benefit of the chamber and its 
				altogether altogetherness, or for the longevity of Mr. 
				Carroway's furor within the chamber, remains untold.

				<div class="accordion-content" id="fifth">
				<p>
				Jay Gatsby himself waited, in a leather smoking chair, which, 
				contrary to the popular naming convention, was neither on 
				fire, nor smoking. He looked extremely tired, yet calm, 
				assuming a very blue look. Almost indigo, was his look. And 
				it never changed color. Not once throughout his death. Not 
				even when Nick Carraway suspended his furor to perform 
				impressions for Gatsby, impressions of famous contemporary 
				film stars: Rudolph Valentino, Harold Lloyd, Harry Houdini, 
				and Gatsby's favorite, Charlie Chaplin. Not even then. 
				Gatsby remained posed, silent before the shut window, 
				ruefully gazing eatward.

				And there, east, across the dark body of water, several 
				electricians deployed by Ameren UE, stood in joint scrutiny 
				round the foot of a mighty metal pole, where, on the 
				tippy-top, a single green bulb, in a state of disrepair, 
				signaled nothing for nobody.
